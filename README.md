### 👋🏻 Hello World

Welcome to my __Github__ profile, I'm glad you could stopped by.

I am an experienced profressional with a diverse background in **Graphic Design**, **Web Development**, **Business Analysis**, and **Project Management**. I love conceptualisation especially when I can use this skill to create new systems, applications, and integrations from scratch - adapting these solutions to solve real world business problems. 

I demonstrate the ability to excel in various roles and leverage skills gained in prior experiences to support effective problem solving and project execution.
