# Hello World üëã
I am a **Business Analyst** with a background in _software programming_ and a love for tech ... wait that's not fair. I ‚ù§Ô∏é a lot of things from anything tech to coming up with new concepts for applications or websites.

I've always liked writing - at first I was convinced that I want to become a fictional writer, but it turns out **technical writing** is more up my alley.

What about the coding part...? Well considering that my husband is a software programmer, programming will always remain close to my heart. While I started my programming career using PHP, I have recently learned Python and am dubbing it one of my favorite programming languages.
