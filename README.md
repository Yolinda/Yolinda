# Hi 👋 my name is Yolinda

I am a results-drive __Business Analyst__ and __Technical Writer__ with a background in software programming. I love *technology* and more so creating concepts for new features and functionality in tech used on a daily basis. 

During the past 15+ years I have worked on projects from various industries, and designed the User Interface of several applications focusing on the overall _user experience_.

I love **applications** and there is nothing in life that gets me more excited than learning to use a new application or tool. Below are some of the applications I have taught myself to use during my career.
